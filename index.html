<h1>Sexuality Flags and LGBT+ Symbols - Bi Flag</h1>

<div class="container">

<p>The rainbow flag, or <a href="https://blog.flagwix.com/bi-flag/">bi flag</a> which represents gay pride, is well-known to all. However, there are many flags that can be used by the LGBTQ+ community to represent the diverse range of gender identities and sexual orientations.</p>

<h2>Why are there so many flags representing the different groups in the community?</h2>

<p>Monica Helms, creator of the Transgender Pride Flag probably said it best when she stated, "I say that the rainbow flag looks like the American flag: everyone&#39;s under it." Each group has its own flag, just like every state.</p>

<p>Why are flags so symbolic? Gilbert Baker, the creator of the first gay pride flag, stated that flags communicate something. Put a rainbow flag on the windshield to say something.</p>

<p>A can be purchased bi flag at <a href="https://blog.flagwix.com/bi-flag/">https://blog.flagwix.com/bi-flag/</a></p>
